CARDIS 2013 - Call for Papers
-----------------------------
Twelfth Smart Card Research and Advanced Application Conference

CARDIS, first held in Lille, France in 1994, will turn 20 next year.
Over these years, as smart cards have become a pervasive, foundational
technology for bootstrapping trust in our society, CARDIS has become
the foremost international academic conference dedicated to research
on smart cards and their applications.

Smart cards are essential building blocks for many security critical
applications and systems used in the payment, content protection,
transportation, mobile and identification industries and are playing
an increasing role in securing critical infrastructures. Established
computer science disciplines such as hardware design, operating
systems, system modeling, cryptography, verification and networking
are adapting to support this ever evolving technology.  Unlike events
devoted to commercial and application aspects of smart cards, the
CARDIS conference gathers researchers and technologists who focus on
all aspects of smart cards development and deployment as well as
applications of these security devices to secure platforms and
systems.

The twelfth Smart Card Research and Advanced Application Conference is
organized by the Chair for Security in Telecommunications (SecT),
Technical University of Berlin and will be held in the Moevenpick
Hotel, Berlin, Germany.

The program committee is seeking original papers on all aspects of
smart cards and secure elements. Submissions across a broad range of
the development phases are encouraged, from exploratory research and
proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment of
smart cards and related technologies. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to:

- Applications for secure embedded systems
- Virtualization and operating systems for secure embedded systems
- Hardware architectures for secure embedded systems
- Security of RFID systems, Internet of Things and Machine to Machine
- Anti-cloning and anti-counterfeiting technologies
- Security of mobile devices and applications of secure elements
- Security of NFC based applications and payment systems
- Trusted computing (mobile TPMs, TrustZone, Trusted Execution Environments, ...)
- Efficient and secure implementations of cryptographic algorithms
- Cryptographic protocols for embedded systems
- Physical attacks and countermeasures
- Secure networking for embedded systems
- Security for access control, identification and transportation tokens
- Secure embedded systems and architectures for critical infrastructure protection
- Formal modeling and formal security proofs
- Validation and certification of embedded systems and applications
- Privacy and trust management for secure embedded systems and applications
- Hardware Trojans implementation and detection
- Design and performance evaluation of operating systems and execution environments for smart cards (e.g., Java Card) 


Submitted papers must be original, unpublished, anonymous and not
simultaneously submitted to journals or other conferences/workshops
with proceedings. Submissions must be formatted according to LNCS
rules and should be at most 15 pages in total. Papers not meeting
these guidelines risk rejection without consideration. Submissions
must be anonymized and avoid obvious self-references, reviews will be
double blind. Authors are invited to submit papers, in PDF format,
using the dedicated submission site:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cardis2013


Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to
register and present the paper. The proceedings will be published in
the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series after the
conference, allowing to use the community feedback received during the
conference for the final proceedings. All papers will also be
available on the CARDIS website.
