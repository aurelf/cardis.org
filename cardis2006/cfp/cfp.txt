CARDIS'06 - Tarragona, CAT, Spain                    April 19-21, 2006

The 7th Smart Card Research and Advanced Application IFIP Conference, 
organized by IFIP Working Groups WG 8.8 and WG 11.2, will be held in 
Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain, April 19-21, 2006.
Since 1994, CARDIS is the foremost international conference dedicated 
to Smart Card research and application. Every two years the scientific 
community congregates to present new ideas and to discuss recent 
developments. Also 2006, thirty eight years after Jürgen Dethloff and 
Helmut Grötrupp filed their idea of incorporating an integrated 
circuit in an identification card, CARDIS'06 will bring together 
leading researchers and practitioners in the development and 
deployment of state of the art Smart Card technologies.
The fast evolutionary process in the field of Information Security 
requires an adequate means to represent the human in the process of 
human-machine interaction. Smart Cards, or, by extension, smart 
devices with their processing power and their direct correlation to 
the user are considered to be the first choice. In rather young and 
new realms, such as Pervasive Computing, smart cards and devices face 
new challenges. Today, the capabilities of smart cards and devices 
with their highly advanced specialized security features reach far 
beyond. They are the basis for many secure systems and play a decisive 
role in ID management. Established computer science areas, like 
hardware design, operating systems, modeling systems, cryptography or 
distributed systems have adapted to this fast growing technology and 
yield new application ranges and investigate emerging challenges for 
these domains. 
Unlike events devoted to commercial and application aspects of Smart 
Cards, CARDIS conferences gather researchers and technologists who are 
focused in all aspects of the design, development, deployment, 
validation and application of Smart Cards or smart personal devices.

------------------
 Conference Scope
------------------

The program committee seeks papers describing the design, development, 
application, and validation of Smart Card technologies. Submissions 
across a broad range of Smart Card development phases are encouraged, 
from exploratory research and proof-of-concept studies to practical 
application and deployment of Smart Card technology.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Smart Device, Person Representation and Ambient Intelligence
* Smart Device, Identity, Privacy and Trust
* Smart Card (Smart Device) and Applications in the Internet, WLAN, 
   DRM, ...
* Smart Card and Smart Device software (OS, VM, API)
* High-level data model and management (On-card data sharing schemes)
* (Distributed) Application development and deployment
* From Smart Card to Smart Device (hardware, form factor, display)
* Biometrics and Smart Cards
* High-speed, small-footprint encryption
* Cryptographic protocols for Smart Cards (and Smart Devices)
* Attacks and countermeasures in hardware and software
* Hardware, software and service (application) validation and 
   certification
* Formal Modeling
* Security of RFID systems
* Interplay of TPMs and Smartcards

 Instructions for Paper Submission
-----------------------------------

Submitted papers should represent novel contributions related to 
the topics listed above. They must be original, unpublished, and 
not submitted to another conference or journal for consideration 
of publication. Papers must be written in English; they should not 
exceed 16 pages in total. When appropriate, authors should arrange 
for a release for publication from their employer prior to 
submission.
Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms will not be 
accepted. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and 
published in the proceedings, which will appear in Springer's 
Lecture Notes in Computer Science and will be available at the 
conference. At least one author of each accepted paper is required 
to register with the conference and present the paper. Abstracts 
and papers must be submitted in electronic form using the conference 
tool setup for this conference (see submission section on 
www.cardis.org). To submit a paper, you must first register with 
the tool. After a successful registration you will be able to enter 
the abstract of your paper and categorize it according to the 
discussed area of research. Abstract information should be provided 
until October 9, 2005. Paper submission can be delayed but must be 
completed until October 16, 2005. If you experience any problems 
submitting your paper you may also use submission@cardis.org. Only 
accepted formats are PDF and PostScript files which have to strictly 
follow the templates or style files indicated by the publisher 
(see submission section on www.cardis.org). Please preview the 
manuscript in a viewer to ensure its integrity before submitting. 
Make sure you visually check uncommon fonts, symbols, equations, etc.
