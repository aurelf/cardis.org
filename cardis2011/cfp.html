<h3>CARDIS 2011</h3>
<p>
September 14&ndash;16, 2011<br/>
Leuven (Belgium)
</p>

<p>
Since 1994, CARDIS is the foremost international conference dedicated to smart
card research and applications. Smart cards, or by extension smart devices are
the basis for many secure systems and play a decisive role in ID management.
Established computer science areas like hardware design, operating systems,
modeling systems, cryptography or distributed systems got adapted to this fast
growing technology and investigate emerging issues resulting from it. Unlike
events devoted to commercial and application aspects of smart cards, CARDIS
conferences gather researchers and technologists who focused on all aspects of
the design, development, deployment, validation and application of smart cards
or smart personal devices.
</p>

<p>
The tenth Smart Card Research and Advanced Application IFIP Conference,
organized by COSIC laboratory, will be held in Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,
Leuven, Belgium. It will be co-located with <a
href="http://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/esorics2011/">ESORICS 2011</a> workshop.
</p>

<p>
The program committee is seeking papers describing the design, development,
application and validation of smart card technologies. Submissions across a
broad range of smart card development phases are encouraged, from exploratory
research and proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment
of smart card technology. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Software environments for embedded systems</li>
<li>Embedded Systems networking</li>
<li>Secure applications for embedded systems</li>
<li>Person representation in embedded systems</li>
<li>Efficient implementations of cryptographic algorithms</li>
<li>Identity, privacy and trust issues</li>
<li>Physical attacks and countermeasures</li>
<li>Cryptographic protocols for embedded systems</li>
<li>Biometrics and smart cards</li>
<li>Formal modeling and formal proofs</li>
<li>Interplay of TPMs and smart cards</li>
<li>Security of RFID systems</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Submitted papers should present novel contributions related to the topics listed
above. They must be original, unpublished, anonymous and not submitted to
another conference or journal for consideration of publication. Papers must be
written in English, they should not exceed 15 pages. Submissions not meeting
these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. All
submissions will be blind-refereed. Authors are invited to submit their
manuscripts (PDF or PS format) by filling in the <a
href="submission.html">submission form</a> available on this web site.
</p>

<p>
Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register
and present the paper. The proceedings will be published as a Springer Lecture
Notes in Computer Science volume.
</p>
