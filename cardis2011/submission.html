<h3>Instructions for Authors</h3>

<p>
Submissions must be anonymous with no author names, affiliations, or obvious
references. Submissions must be at most 15 pages, excluding references and
appendices, and 18 pages in total. The paper must be in single-column format,
use at least 11-point fonts, and have reasonable margins. Submissions should
begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction
should summarize the paper&apos;s contributions at a level understandable to a
non-expert in the field. Reviewers are not required to read appendices, so
papers should be intelligible without them.
</p>

<p>
Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX and submitted as PDF using type-1
fonts (see <a
href="http://www.iacr.org/conferences/crypto2006/docprep.html">here</a> for

files indicated by Springer (the llncs style files for LaTex, LaTex2e and Word
are available <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">here</a>).
Papers must be submitted electronically thanks to the <a
href="https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=cardis2011">CARDIS 2011

<p>
Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors
published, submitted, or is planning to submit before the notification-date to
any conference/workshop with proceedings. Accepted submissions may not appear in
any other conference or workshop that has proceedings. The program committee may
share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs to ensure
adherence to this policy. Authors uncertain whether their submission conforms to
this policy should contact the program chair. The authors of submitted papers
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference if it is
accepted. Submissions not meeting any of the guidelines above risk rejection
without consideration of their merits.
