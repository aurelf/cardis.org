Title: Analysis of executable code: The software framework "Insight".
<br/><br/>
Abstract:
Automatic analysis of programs from their executable files is a recent
field of research, opening the way to new applications of software
verification (mobile code, off the shelf components, malware) and more
accurate and reliable analyses (taking into account the compilation
step). I will present a new software environment : INSIGHT, in progress
in LaBRI. This software allows to analyse executable code, using several
static analysis techniques including abstract interpretation, slicing,
etc. Then I will talk about the applications to analysis of viruses, and
possibly to side channel attacks.</p>
