<h1>CARDIS&nbsp;2014: Call for Papers</h1>

<p>CARDIS&nbsp;2014 is the <i>13th Smart Card Research and Advanced
Application Conference</i>. It is organized by the CNAM and will be
held in Paris on November&nbsp;5-7, 2014.</p>
    <p class="screenonly" id="cfp-pdf">The Call for Papers is also
  available for download as a

<h2>Motivation and Scope</h2>
<p>Since 1994, CARDIS is the foremost international conference
dedicated to smart card research and applications. Smart cards and
secure elements are the basis for many secure systems and play a
decisive role in ID management. Established computer science areas like
hardware design, operating systems, system modeling, cryptography,
verification and networking got adapted to this fast growing technology
and investigate emerging issues resulting from it. Unlike events
devoted to commercial and application aspects of smart cards, CARDIS
conferences gather researchers and technologists who focus on all
aspects of the design, development, deployment, validation and
application of smart cards and secure elements in secure platforms or
systems.</p>
<p>The program committee is seeking original papers on all aspects of
smart cards and secure elements. Submissions across a broad range of
the development phases are encouraged, from exploratory research and
proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment of
smart cards and related technologies. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Smart cards and their applications</li>
  <li>Software for secure embedded systems (operating systems, virtual
machines, ...)</li>
  <li>Hardware architectures for secure embedded systems</li>
  <li>Security of RFID systems and sensor nodes</li>
  <li>Security of mobile devices and applications</li>
  <li>Efficient and secure implementations of cryptographic algorithms</li>
  <li>Cryptographic protocols for embedded systems</li>
  <li>Physical attacks and countermeasures</li>
  <li>Secure applications for embedded systems</li>
  <li>Embedded systems networking</li>
  <li>Person representation in embedded systems</li>
  <li>Formal modeling and formal proofs</li>
  <li>Validation and certification of embedded systems and applications</li>
  <li>Identity, privacy and trust issues</li>
</ul>

<h2>Paper submission</h2>
<p>Authors are invited to submit papers (PDF or PS format) with novel
contributions electronically using the submission form available on the
following web site: <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cardis2014">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cardis2014</a>.
Submitted papers must be original, unpublished, <em>anonymous</em>,
and not submitted to journals or other conferences/workshops that have
proceedings. Submissions must be written in English and should be at
most 15 pages in total including bibliography and appendices. Papers
not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration. All
submissions will be blind-refereed.</p>

<p>Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to
register and present the paper. The proceedings will be published in
the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Accepted
papers should follow the LNCS default author instructions
  at <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>.
  LNCS LaTeX class file can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/llncs2e.zip">here</a>.</p>
