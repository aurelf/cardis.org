The eighth Smart Card Research and Advanced Application IFIP Conference, 
organized by IFIP Working Groups WG 8.8 and WG 11.2, will be held in 
Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey, UK. Since 1994, 
CARDIS has been the foremost international conference dedicated to smart 
card research and applications. Every two years the scientific community 
congregates to present new ideas and to discuss recent developments. 
Also in 2008, forty years after Jürgen Dethloff and Helmut Grötrupp 
filled their idea of incorporating an integrated circuit in an 
identification card, CARDIS'08 will bring together leading researchers 
and practitioners in the development and deployment of state-of-the-art 
smart card technologies. The fast evolutionary process in the field of 
information security requires adequate means to represent humans in the 
process of human-machine interactions. Smart cards, or by extension 
smart devices with their processing power and their direct correlation 
to the user are considered to be the first choice. In rather young and 
new realms, such as pervasive computing, smart cards and devices face 
new challenges. Today, the capabilities of smart cards and devices with 
their highly advanced specialized security features reach a wide variety
of applications. They are the basis for many secure systems and play a 
decisive role in ID management. Established computer science areas like 
hardware design, operating systems, modeling systems, cryptography or 
distributed systems got adapted to this fast growing technology and 
investigate emerging issues resulting from it. Unlike events devoted to 
commercial and application aspects of smart cards, CARDIS conferences 
gather researchers and technologists who focused on all aspects of the 
design, development, deployment, validation and application of smart 
cards or smart personal devices.

-----------------
Conference Scope: 
-----------------

The program committee is seeking papers describing the design, 
development, application and validation of smart card technologies. 
Submissions across a broad range of smart card development phases are 
encouraged, from exploratory research and proof-of-concept studies to 
practical applications and deployment of smart card technology. As a 
response to the growing development of contactless applications and RFID 
systems, a special interest is also devoted to low cost cryptographic 
mechanisms and physical security of constrained devices. Topics of 
interest include, but are not limited to: 

- From smart cards to smart devices (hardware, form factor, display)
- Software environments for smart cards and devices (OS, VM, API)
- Smart cards and devices networking and high-level data models
- Smart cards and devices applications, development and deployment
- Person representation and biometrics using smart technologies
- Identity, privacy and trust issues for smart technologies
- High-speed, small-footprint implementations of cryptographic algorithms
- Attacks and countermeasures in hardware and software
- Cryptographic protocols for smart cards and devices
- Biometrics and smart cards
- Formal modeling of environments and applications
- Interplay of TPMs and smart cards
- Security of RFID systems

Papers submission and proceedings:
----------------------------------

Submitted papers should present novel contributions related to the 
topics listed above. They must be original, unpublished, anonymous and 
not submitted to another conference or journal for consideration of 
publication. Papers must be written in English, they should not exceed 
15 pages. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection 
without consideration of their merits. All submissions will be blind-
refereed. Authors are invited to submit their manuscripts (PDF or PS 
format) by filling in the submission form available on the following web 
site: http://www.scc.rhul.ac.uk/submissions/. 

Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to 
register and present the paper. The proceedings will be published as a 
Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science volume.
