<h3>Visa information</h3>


<p>Since 12 December 2008 Switzerland is an associated member state of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" target="_blank">Schengen agreement</a> and hence part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen area</a>. Please check the visa requirements for your nationality under the following link: <a href="https://www.bfm.admin.ch/dam/data/bfm/rechtsgrundlagen/weisungen/visa/bfm/bfm-anh01-liste1-e.pdf">Overview of ID and visa provisions according to nationality</a><a href="https://www.bfm.admin.ch/dam/data/bfm/rechtsgrundlagen/weisungen/visa/bfm/bfm-anh01-liste1-e.pdf"> </a>(PDF). Schengen visas are valid for Switzerland and all other areas of the Schengen member states (providing nothing to the contrary is noted on the visa).</p>
<p>The Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police maintains a list of <a href="http://www.bfm.admin.ch/content/bfm/en/home/themen/einreise/faq.html" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions</a> regarding Visa issues.

The embassy and consulate websites have very helpful information about procedures, timelines, communities served, required documentation, and fees.</p>
