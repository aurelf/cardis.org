<p>
<font SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
Please read these guidelines carefully. They were written to help you provide
your submission with its best possible chance to be accepted. As you know, the
Program Committee can't accept every paper submitted to the conference, and this
document was put together to help improve your odds of getting your paper
accepted.
<p>
The program committee seeks papers describing application and
 system software that extends the reach of the use of smart
 cards in systems for authentication, electronic commerce, and
 secure personal data storage. Submissions across a broad range
 of smart card development phases are encouraged, from
  exploratory research and proof-of-concept studies to practical
 application and deployment of smart card technology.


<p>

<b align=left>CONFERENCE DATES:</b>
<p>
CARDIS '02, the Fifth Smart 
Card Research and Advanced Application Conference will be held
November 20-22 in San Jose, California, USA.

<p>
For your convenience, here is a summary of the important information
in the Call For Papers:

<UL>
<p>
<LI>Authors must submit a full paper that should consist of a traditional
abstract that summarizes the content/ideas of the entire paper, followed by the
full paper. It should include references to related work, figures, tables, and
graphs that are central to understanding the paper. 
</p>


<LI>THE NEXT STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT.  PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.


<p>
One copy of a full paper, in PDF format,
must be submitted electronically using the <A href="submit.html">Web submission form</A>.
</p>

<li>The web form will also require the authors to provide the following
information:
<p>
<ul>
<LI>The title and authors of the manuscript.
<LI>The name of one author who will serve as a contact, with regular and
   electronic mail addresses, daytime and evening telephone numbers,
   and a fax number.
<LI>An indication of which, if any, of the authors are full-time
   students.
</ul>

<p>
<LI>All submissions will be acknowledged. 
</p>

<p>
<LI>The paper should be about 8 to 14 typeset pages using an 11 pt font or
larger.
</p>

<p>
<LI>Prizes will be awarded for Best Paper and Best Student Paper.
</p>

</UL>

<b align=left>WHAT KINDS OF PAPERS DOES USENIX PUBLISH?</b>

<p>
The most important thought to keep in mind when deciding whether to submit a
paper is "What will the audience or readers learn from my paper?" We don't
expect every paper to report on a major breakthrough, but we do look for
something new, potentially useful, and not entirely obvious. Think about how
different your work is from previously published papers; it may be good work but
if there is nothing new to learn, it isn't worth reading (or writing) a paper
about it. Think about how other people might find your work useful; can they
apply what you are teaching them to their own systems? And, does your work
really improve upon the previous state of the art? Or does it show how other
people have been confused? "Negative results" that contradict the conventional
wisdom are often as important as positive results. 
<p>
Trying to decide if something is non-obvious isn't easy (patent lawyers make
lots of money arguing about this), and sometimes the best ideas seem obvious in
hindsight. However, if several people have done the same thing, and you are
simply the first person to have considered writing a paper about it, perhaps it
is too obvious. 
<p>
The Program Committee will also be trying to decide if papers will lead to a
good 25-minute presentation. Some papers are just too complex to be presented
this way (perhaps you should focus on just one aspect); other papers just don't
have enough to talk about for that long. On the other hand, a few rare papers
are accepted mostly because the committee expects them to produce an interesting
talk, but that might not otherwise merit publication. 
<p>
Again, when you are writing your paper, keep in mind "what do I intend to teach
the reader?" That means keeping the paper focused on one or a few main points.
Don't try to cram too many big issues into the paper, and don't fill it up with
irrelevant details. But do include enough background for the reader to
understand why your problem is important, how your work relates to previous work
in the field, and how it might fit into a practical system. Also, provide enough
detail for the reader to put your performance measurements in context. It is
vitally important to provide a good bibliography, both so that you give proper
credit to previous work, and so that a reader can know where to turn to find
additional background information. The Program Committee will not look kindly on
a paper if the author doesn't appear to be familiar with the current literature.

<p>
<HR>

<b align=left>MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE</b>
<p>
Lots of papers and books have been written about how to write a
good paper.  We'd like to suggest that you read a paper called 
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/samples/submit/advice.html">An
Evaluation of the Ninth SOSP Submissions; or, How (and How Not) to
Write a Good Systems Paper</a>.  This was written by Roy Levin and
David D. Redell, the program committee co-chairs for SOSP-9, and
first appeared in <i>ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review</i>,  Vol. 17,
No. 3 (July, 1983), pages 35-40.
</p>
<p>
Although SOSP and CARDIS have different foci, Levin and Redell
give good advice for authors of any kind of systems paper.
The authors have graciously agreed to make this paper available
online.
</p>

<p>
If you have any other questions, feel free to send mail to the
Program Chair at <a
href="mailto:cardis02chair@usenix.org">cardis02chair@usenix.org</a>.
</p>

<HR>
<p>
<b align=left>HOW SHOULD I GET MY MANUSCRIPT TO YOU?</b>
</p>
The Program Committee would prefer to receive submissions via the 
Web form. While we understand that there are
people who may not yet have access to the Web, using the Web for a majority of
submissions will not only help in automating the truly tedious administrative
work in paper submission, but it will also help in avoiding paper printing and
submission costs all around. If you cannot submit your paper via the Web for any
reason whatsoever, please contact the Program Chair (<A
href="mailto:cardis02chair@usenix.org">cardis02chair@usenix.org</A>)
for alternative means of submission. 
<p>
We have found in the past that PDF files (readable by Acroread or Acrobat) are
often the best means of submitting papers.
<p>
If the paper you submit via the web form is missing figures, tables or other
illustrations that are present in your original paper, please indicate this with
a prominent note and contact the Program Chairs for submitting these
illustrations.
<p>
Finally, if you have any other questions, at any time during the entire
submissions process, especially if you have a paper idea but have concerns about
it not being "right" for this conference, PLEASE send mail to the Program Chair
at <A href="mailto:cardis02chair@usenix.org">cardis02chair@usenix.org</A>. 
<p>
<B>Good Luck,<br>
The Program Committee</B>
