	<p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Students 
	whose papers have been accepted for presentation at the conference are encouraged to apply for the Best 
	Student Paper Award.  The judging panel will evaluate the papers submitted, based upon the criteria presented 
	below, and present the award to the recipient at the conference. Presentation of the paper at the conference 
	will not form part of the evaluation for this award.<br><br>
	<strong>Eligibility</strong><br>
	Papers eligible for the award must have a majority of the content written by the student. Students as the sole 
	author is preferred, however, where a student co-authors a paper (with their supervisor, other academics, etc.) 
	all the co-authors must provide confirmation that the majority of the paper was written by the student applying 
	for the award. Papers with more than three authors are not eligible for consideration.<br><br>

	Papers authored by more than one student may apply. If the submission is successful then the award will be shared 
	by the student authors.<br><br>

	Students may be enrolled either full-time or part-time in Masters or Doctoral studies in any smartcard related 
	discipline (e.g. computer science, computer engineering, information systems, information sciences, security 
	sciences, electrical engineering, etc.).<br><br>

	The Application for Best Student Paper Award Form must be completed and signed by all authors and submitted to 
	the Conference Programme Chair by May 10, 2004:
