    <td><p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        6th Smart Card Research and Advanced Application IFIP Conference, organized 
        by IFIP Working Groups WG8.8 and WG11.2, will be part of the 18th IFIP 
        World Computer Congress (www.wcc2004.org), held in Toulouse, August 22-27, 
        2004.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 
        1994, CARDIS has been the premier international research conference dedicated 
        to smart cards and their applications. Every two years the scientific 
        community meets together for the conference. Ten years after, like its 
        predecessors and back to Europe and France, CARDIS'04 will bring together 
        researchers and practitioners in the development and deployment of smart 
        card technologies and applications.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        smart card, or, by extension, smart device with its processing power and 
        link to its owner, is the good candidate for the person representation 
        in the Information Society. Smart card or smart device will be the potential 
        human representation or delegate in Ambient Intelligence (Pervasive Computing), 
        where every appliances and computers will be connected, and where control 
        and trust of your environment will be the next decade challenge.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Smart 
        card research is of increasing importance as the need for information 
        security increases rapidly, especially in response to new and urgent demands. 
        Smart card with its security features is a seed of secure system and will 
        play a huge role in ID management. In many computer science areas, smart 
        cards introduce new dimensions and disciplines. Disciplines like hardware 
        design, operating system, modeling system, cryptography or distributed 
        systems find new areas of applications or issues but also smart cards 
        create new challenge for these domains. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unlike 
        events devoted to commercial and application aspects of smart cards, CARDIS 
        conferences gather researchers and technologists who are focused in all 
        aspects of the design, development, deployment, validation and application 
        of smart cards or smart personal devices.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Conference 
        scope</strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        program committee seeks papers describing the design, development, application, 
        and validation of smart card technologies. Submissions across a broad 
        range of smart card development phases are encouraged, from exploratory 
        research and proof-of-concept studies to practical application and deployment 
        of smart card technology.</font></p>
